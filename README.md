# Cinder Canvas
---

## About
Trying to implement Canvas2D on top of amazing [Cinder](http://libcinder.org/) framework which support OSX, Windows and iOS. The reason I choose Cinder mainly is that it produces incredible small executable file(an empty project produces less than 2m program). I'm not going to stop developing [Mural](), and this will be part of [Mural]() after features completed(more like a simple hacking project).
